## Lessons learned

Before I started the project, I knew that the snake game logic would be the most difficult part of the whole project, since i've never done any sort of game like this before. So I was kind of winging it all, which by the end made the game work but needs improvements to make the game bug free. So I should've researched a bit more on how a proper snake game and game overall is created to make it as best as possible.
This was also my first time working with a backend on vercel, which I did prepare before the project period started, so I didn't have to deal with deployment issues while I was making the website.
